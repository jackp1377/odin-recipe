        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>salt and other condiments/spices</li>

    <p>
        how 2 make:
        <ol>
            <li>oil in pan (I should've mentioned you'd need that yeah) </li>
            <li>turn it to hot. then slice bacon and put it in</li>
            <li>slice up carrots and all your other ingredients too. put them in
                when ready
            </li>
            <li>whisk the eggs and put them in</li>
            <li>keep the eggs mobile so they dont burn but dont scramble them too
                soon! we want some <em>strong, cohesive </em>eggs
            </li>
            <li>put in your spices and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
