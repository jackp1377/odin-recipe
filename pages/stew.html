        how 2 make
        <ol>
            <li>I want you to put the broth in the pot. like halfway full</li>
            <li>next you must boil said broth. maybe salt it and add other spices</li>
            <li>ok now cut the bacon and put it in. do the same with the veggies after
                boiling the bacon for a bit. you dont want them to get too soft
            </li>
            <li>
                alright at this point put the noodles in there and crack the egg into it.
                cook it kinda hot
            </li>
            <li>ok add more spices now.</li>
