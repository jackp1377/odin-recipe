    <h3>Here's how to do it:</h3>
    <p>
        ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>Maruchan ramen</li>
            <li>salt, pepper, whatever other condiments or spices</li>
            <li>bacon</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>carrots and celery</li>
            <li>small pot in which you cook</li>
        </ul>
        alright gang let's chef up!

        how 2 make it:
        <ol>
            <li>first boil some water</li>
            <li>put the noodles in there. whilst they grow softer, cut some bacon into 
                little bits (but not too little!)
            </li>
            <li>when the noodles are quite softened, drain most of the water. then put
                the bacon in. leave it on high so the bacon gets cooked well!!
            </li>
            <li>cut up carrots and celery, then put it in. by this point you may want 
                to add a little more water
            </li>
            <li>crack eggs directly into your concoction! leave it on high so they cook.
                don't dash them - we want them to be kinda solid
            </li>
            <li>after some cooking, add your condiments. then put the flavor packet in. 
                now we're done!
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
